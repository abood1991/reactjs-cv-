      <p>
        At BeCode, we learned how to learn, we have discovered all aspects of
        creating a website or mobile application. The training is thus
        interested in both "Front-End" and "Back-End". The Front-End is the
        elements of the site that we see on the screen and with which we can
        interact. The Back-End is the internal structure of the site or
        application.
